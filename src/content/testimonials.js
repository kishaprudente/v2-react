      'Kisha is a highly motivated, passionate developer who does not shy away from challenges. I’ve been fortunate enough to watch Kisha at her best during our time in the Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp and have been inspired by her dedication to not only learning but mastering new technologies outside of course requirements, such as authentication with Passport. During our months together, she was always willing to assist other classmates during office hours, even after completing her own assignments, and she remains a highly knowledgeable and dependable teammate even after graduation as we continue to develop projects together. She has demonstrated immense patience, persistence, and success in the high intensity bootcamp setting during these unprecedented times, which is indicative of the innate skillsets she possesses as well as her genuine, hardworking character. Self-driven, curious, and compassionate, Kisha would be a truly valuable addition to any professional environment.',

      'During the entire time I had the pleasure of teaching Kisha she not only demonstrated an exceptional capacity to rapidly grasp the material but she was attentive and helpful to every other student in the class. She always took time to help anyone working with her, ensuring they understood the material. Her dedication to the cohort was unquestionable, she stayed for office hours every single class without fail even when she had already completed all of her assignments. In fact she would propose completing assignments using more advanced techniques and new technologies to challenge herself and other students. She is an extraordinarily hard worker, a natural engineer, and a kind and nurturing teacher.',
